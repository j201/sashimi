Modules:

A module is declared with a module statement:
module "foo";
The module continues until the end of the file or another module statement.

A module is imported by assigning it to a local variable
foo = import "foo";

Exports can be done one of two ways, either by assigning to export:
export = {.piApprox, 22/7};
or by prepending defines with export:
export piApprox = 22/7;
The two styles cannot be mixed in a module.
