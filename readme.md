##Sashimi

An altjs in progress...

---

###Todo:

- module system
- core lib implementation
- multiple function bodies
- only have assignments in lets, for maps (and maybe lists), and top-level defines
- special js module

###Possible future features:

- loop/recur
- multimethods
	- every composite data type will have a internal type parameter, which multimethods will dispatch on
	- new (namespaced) types can be defined
- lazy sequences
